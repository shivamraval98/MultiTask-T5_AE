# MultiTask-T5_AE :book:
[Exploring a Unified Sequence-To-Sequence Transformer for Medical Product Safety Monitoring in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05815.pdf) accepted to be published in EMNLP 2021 Findings track explores the sequence-to-sequence transformers to detect and extract Adverse Events (AE) from various source for medical product safety monitoring.  
Adverse Events (AE) are harmful events resulting from the use of medical products. Although social media may be crucial for early AE detection, the sheer scale of this data makes it logistically intractable to analyze using human agents, with NLP representing the only low-cost and scalable alternative. In this paper, we frame AE Detection and Extraction as a sequence-to-sequence problem using the T5 model architecture and achieve strong performance improvements over competitive baselines on several English benchmarks (F1 = 0.71, 12.7% relative improvement for AE Detection; Strict F1 = 0.713, 12.4% relative improvement for AE Extraction).

Given an input sequence of words that potentially contains drug, dosage and AE mentions, we frame the AE detection (i.e. binary classification) and extraction (i.e. span detection) tasks as seq-to-seq problems, further finetuning T5 to generate Y, which is either the classification label or the text span with the AE. The example of prefixes used is shown in the figure below:

## Datasets
The datasets used for experimentation is mentioned below:

#### 1. SMM4H
This dataset was introduced for the Shared Tasks on AE in the Workshop on Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) (Weissenbacher et al., 2018). The dataset is composed of Twitter posts, typically short, informal texts with non-standard ortography, and it contains annotations for both detection (i.e., Task 1, classification) and extraction (i.e., Task 2, NER) of Adverse Events. The preparation of AE Detection dataset for SMM4H Task 1 requires SMM4H19_Task1.csv file in the /src/data/datasets/SMM4H_Task1/ folder. (column names: tweet_id, tweet, label). Similarly as Task 1 dataset, the importer function for Task 2 expects a file SMM4H19_Task2.csv in the /src/data/datasets/SMM4H_Task2/ folder. (column names: tweet_id,begin,end,type,extraction,drug,tweet,meddra_code,meddra_term <br />

#### 2. CADEC
CADEC contains 1,250 medical forum posts annotated with patient-reported AEs. In this dataset, texts are long and informal, often deviating from English syntax and punctuation rules. Forum posts may contain more than one AE. For our goals, we adopted the training, validation, and test splits proposed by Dai et al. (2020). The importer for CADEC expects a zip file CADEC.zip in the /src/data/datasets/CADEC/ folder and the dataset is available at: https://data.csiro.au/collections/collection/CIcsiro:10948/SQcadec/RP1/RS25/RORELEVANCE/STsearch-by-keyword/RI1/RT1/ (download the CADEC.v2.zip)  <br />

#### 3. ADE Corpus v2 
This dataset (Gurulingappa et al., 2012) contains case reports extracted from MEDLINE and it was used for multi-task training, as it contains annotations for all tasks: drugs, dosage, AE detection and extraction. Splits are stratified, to maintain an equal ratio of positive and negative examples.This dataset is automatically prepared by the code by loading the dataset from the huggingface datasets package.
